We encourage prospective participants to  submit talk abstracts (max 300 words)
on topics related to Sustainable RSE Ecosystems within eScience.

Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

- Experiences as an RSE in eScience
- Struggles between RSEs and domain scientists - how to find the common ground?
- Different roles in the development of research software
- How to make the eScience and RSE ecosystem more sustainable? 
- What can the eScience community do to support their RSEs? How can RSEs develop and progress their careers within the eScience community?
- How to argue for funding to develop and sustain scientific software, and support the RSEs doing the work?
- Examples of RSEs enabling sustainability within the eScience community


We will ask the authors of accepted abstracts and presentations to self-publish (after
revisions, if applicable) to an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo, arxiv). Our
website will then provide links to the self-published documents.

Accepted submitters will also be invited to present in-person at
the workshop, after which there will be a short panel discussion and then breakout
sessions with the larger group of attendees.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters
and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the
eScience community.
